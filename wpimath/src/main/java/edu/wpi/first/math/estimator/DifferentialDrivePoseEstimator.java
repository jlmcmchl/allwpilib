/**
 * This class wraps {@link DifferentialDriveOdometry Differential Drive Odometry} to fuse
 * latency-compensated vision measurements with differential drive encoder measurements. It is
 * intended to be a drop-in replacement for {@link DifferentialDriveOdometry}; in fact, if you never
 * call {@link DifferentialDrivePoseEstimator#addVisionMeasurement} and only call {@link
 * DifferentialDrivePoseEstimator#update} then this will behave exactly the same as
 * DifferentialDriveOdometry.
 *
 * <p>{@link DifferentialDrivePoseEstimator#update} should be called every robot loop.
 *
 * <p>{@link DifferentialDrivePoseEstimator#addVisionMeasurement} can be called as infrequently as
 * you want; if you never call it then this class will behave exactly like regular encoder odometry.
 *
 * <p>The state-space system used internally has the following states (x), and outputs (y):
 *
 * <p><strong> x = [x, y, theta]ᵀ </strong> in the field coordinate system containing x position, y
 * position, and heading.
 *
 * <p><strong> y = [x, y, theta]ᵀ </strong> from vision containing x position, y position, and
 * heading.
